	<h1>The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing</h1>
	<h2>Aesop’s Fables</h2>
	<h3>Aesop for Children – Library of Congress</h3>
	<p>A certain Wolf could not get enough to eat because of the watchfulness of the Shepherds. But one night he found a sheep
		skin that had been cast aside and forgotten. The next day, dressed in the skin, the Wolf strolled into the pasture with
		the Sheep. Soon a little Lamb was following him about and was quickly led away to slaughter.</p>
	<p>That evening the Wolf entered the fold with the flock. But it happened that the Shepherd took a fancy for mutton broth
		that very evening, and picking up a knife, went to the fold. There the first he laid hands on and killed was the Wolf.
